# Airline-Delay-Analysis



From an industry-wide perspective, delays contribute to congestion at airports, inefficient air traffic management, and increased environmental impact due to excessive fuel burn and carbon emissions. The economic consequences extend beyond airlines to include airports, ground service providers, and businesses dependent on timely air travel, such as logistics and tourism industries.

Understanding the key factors contributing to delays - ranging from weather conditions, air traffic congestion, and mechanical issues to staffing shortages, security procedures, and airline scheduling inefficiencies - is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate their occurrence. By leveraging data analytics, predictive modeling, and real-time monitoring, stakeholders can identify patterns, anticipate potential disruptions, and implement proactive solutions.

 

1. What are the busiest months and airports for flights?

2. Which months experience the highest delay rates?

3. How do delay patterns vary across different airlines?

4. What are the primary causes of delays (e.g., carrier reasons, weather, late aircraft)?

5. Which airports are most affected by weather-related delays?

6. How do delays differ between peak and off-peak seasons?

7. Are there geographical patterns in delay occurrences (e.g., coastal vs. inland airports)?

8. Do certain regions experience higher delays due to weather conditions?

9. What percentage of total flights experience delays of over 15 minutes?

10. Are there airports or airlines with significantly better on-time performance?
